[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=abapinho_abapTimeMachine&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=abapinho_abapTimeMachine)

`abapTimeMachine` provides a simple way to look at past versions of classes, function groups, etc, as a whole (as opposed to the crappy native include-oriented approach). Alternatively, it also partially emulates [git-blame](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-blame) by showing "what revision and author last modified each line of a file" for any given version.

## Why

ABAP's versioning system is unbelievably bad. There is no native way to see how a whole class or a whole function group were at a given time in the past. Besides, it makes it very hard to find out which user was responsible for which changes. `abapTimeMachine` is here to solve both these problems.
